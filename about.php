						Acrokart is an online shopping platform/site that provides a customer to place online orders for items and/or other goods from a store. When ordering goods, we provide a virtual shopping cart for holding items selected for purchase. Successive items selected for purchase are placed into the virtual shopping cart until a customer completes their shopping trip and then, the customer can directly place the order from the cart.

								Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
